<p align="center">✨✨✨ Platform agnostic logger for NestJS based on Pino with <b>REQUEST CONTEXT IN EVERY LOG</b> ✨✨✨</p>

---

<p align="center"><b>This is documentation for v2+ which works with NestJS 8+.<br/>Please see documentation for the previous major version which works with NestJS < 8 <a href="https://github.com/iamolegga/nestjs-pino/tree/v1.4.0#readme">here</a>.</b></p>

---

## Install

```sh
npm i nestjs-pino pino-http
```

## Example

Firstly, import module with `LoggerModule.forRoot(...)` or `LoggerModule.forRootAsync(...)` only once in root module (check out module configuration docs [below](#configuration)):

```ts
import { LoggerModule } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Module({
  imports: [LoggerModule.forRoot()],
})
class AppModule {}
```

Secondly, set up app logger:

```ts
import { Logger } from 'nestjs-pino';

const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, { bufferLogs: true });
app.useLogger(app.get(Logger));
```

Now you can use one of two loggers:

```ts
// NestJS standard built-in logger.
// Logs will be produced by pino internally
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common';

export class MyService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(MyService.name);
  foo() {
    // All logger methods have args format the same as pino, but pino methods
    // `trace` and `info` are mapped to `verbose` and `log` to satisfy
    // `LoggerService` interface of NestJS:
    this.logger.verbose({ foo: 'bar' }, 'baz %s', 'qux');
    this.logger.debug('foo %s %o', 'bar', { baz: 'qux' });
    this.logger.log('foo');
  }
}
```

Usage of the standard logger is recommended and idiomatic for NestJS. But there is one more option to use:

```ts
import { PinoLogger, InjectPinoLogger } from 'nestjs-pino';

export class MyService {
  constructor(
    private readonly logger: PinoLogger
  ) {
    // Optionally you can set context for logger in constructor or ...
    this.logger.setContext(MyService.name);
  }

  constructor(
    // ... set context via special decorator
    @InjectPinoLogger(MyService.name)
    private readonly logger: PinoLogger
  ) {}

  foo() {
    // PinoLogger has same methods as pino instance
    this.logger.trace({ foo: 'bar' }, 'baz %s', 'qux');
    this.logger.debug('foo %s %o', 'bar', { baz: 'qux' });
    this.logger.info('foo');
  }
}
```

Output:

```json

## Comparison with others

There are other Nestjs loggers. Key purposes of this module are:

- to be idiomatic NestJS logger
- to log in JSON format (thanks to [pino](https://getpino.io/#/) - [super fast logger](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/benchmarks.md)) [why](https://www.loggly.com/use-cases/json-logging-best-practices/) [you](https://hackernoon.com/log-everything-as-json-hmq32ax) [should](https://blog.treasuredata.com/blog/2012/04/26/log-everything-as-json/) [use](https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/) [JSON](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/170528)
- to log every request/response automatically (thanks to [pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http#pino-http))
- to bind request data to the logs automatically from any service on any application layer without passing request context (thanks to [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#async_context_class_asynclocalstorage))
- to have another alternative logger with same API as `pino` instance (`PinoLogger`) for experienced `pino` users to make more comfortable usage.

| Logger             | Nest App logger | Logger service | Auto-bind request data to logs |

## Configuration

### Zero configuration

Just import `LoggerModule` to your module:

```ts
import { LoggerModule } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Module({
  imports: [LoggerModule.forRoot()],
  ...
})
class MyModule {}
```

### Configuration params

The following interface is using for the configuration:

```ts
interface Params {
  /**
   * Optional parameters for `pino-http` module
   * @see https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http#api
   */
  pinoHttp?:
    | pinoHttp.Options
    | DestinationStream
    | [pinoHttp.Options, DestinationStream];

  /**
   * Optional parameter for routing. It should implement interface of
   * parameters of NestJS built-in `MiddlewareConfigProxy['forRoutes']`.
   * @see https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware#applying-middleware
   * It can be used for both disabling automatic req/res logs (see above) and
   * removing request context from following logs. It works for all requests by
   * default. If you only need to turn off the automatic request/response
   * logging for some specific (or all) routes but keep request context for app
   * logs use `pinoHttp.autoLogging` field.
   */
  forRoutes?: Parameters<MiddlewareConfigProxy['forRoutes']>;

  /**
   * Optional parameter for routing. It should implement interface of
   * parameters of NestJS built-in `MiddlewareConfigProxy['exclude']`.
   * @see https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware#applying-middleware
   * It can be used for both disabling automatic req/res logs (see above) and
   * removing request context from following logs. It works for all requests by
   * default. If you only need to turn off the automatic request/response
   * logging for some specific (or all) routes but keep request context for app
   * logs use `pinoHttp.autoLogging` field.
   */
  exclude?: Parameters<MiddlewareConfigProxy['exclude']>;

  /**
   * Optional parameter to skip pino configuration in case you are using
   * FastifyAdapter, and already configure logger in adapter's config. The Pros
   * and cons of this approach are described in the FAQ section of the
   * documentation:
   * @see https://github.com/iamolegga/nestjs-pino#faq.
   */
  useExisting?: true;

  /**
   * Optional parameter to change property name `context` in resulted logs,
   * so logs will be like:
   * {"level":30, ... "RENAME_CONTEXT_VALUE_HERE":"AppController" }
   */
  renameContext?: string;
}
```

### Synchronous configuration

Use `LoggerModule.forRoot` method with argument of [Params interface](#configuration-params):

```ts
import { LoggerModule } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Module({
  imports: [
    LoggerModule.forRoot({
      pinoHttp: [
        {
          name: 'add some name to every JSON line',
          level: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' ? 'debug' : 'info',
          // install 'pino-pretty' package in order to use the following option
          transport: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
            ? { target: 'pino-pretty' }
            : undefined,


          // and all the other fields of:
          // - https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http#api
          // - https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/HEAD/docs/api.md#options-object


        },
        someWritableStream
      ],
      forRoutes: [MyController],
      exclude: [{ method: RequestMethod.ALL, path: 'check' }]
    })
  ],
  ...
})
class MyModule {}
```

### Asynchronous configuration

With `LoggerModule.forRootAsync` you can, for example, import your `ConfigModule` and inject `ConfigService` to use it in `useFactory` method.

`useFactory` should return object with [Params interface](#configuration-params) or undefined

Here's an example:

```ts
import { LoggerModule } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Injectable()
class ConfigService {
  public readonly level = 'debug';
}

@Module({
  providers: [ConfigService],
  exports: [ConfigService]
})
class ConfigModule {}

@Module({
  imports: [
    LoggerModule.forRootAsync({
      imports: [ConfigModule],
      inject: [ConfigService],
      useFactory: async (config: ConfigService) => {
        await somePromise();
        return {
          pinoHttp: { level: config.level },
        };
      }
    })
  ],
  ...
})
class TestModule {}
```

### Asynchronous logging

> In essence, asynchronous logging enables even faster performance by `pino`.

Please, read [pino asynchronous mode docs](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/asynchronous.md) first. There is a possibility of the most recently buffered log messages being lost in case of a system failure, e.g. a power cut.

If you know what you're doing, you can enable it like so:

```ts
import pino from 'pino';
import { LoggerModule } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Module({
  imports: [
    LoggerModule.forRoot({
      pinoHttp: {
        stream: pino.destination({
          dest: './my-file', // omit for stdout
          minLength: 4096, // Buffer before writing
          sync: false, // Asynchronous logging
        }),
      },
    }),
  ],
  ...
})
class MyModule {}
```

See [pino.destination](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#pino-destination)

## Testing a class that uses @InjectPinoLogger

This package exposes a `getLoggerToken()` function that returns a prepared injection token based on the provided context.
Using this token, you can provide a mock implementation of the logger using any of the standard custom provider techniques, including `useClass`, `useValue` and `useFactory`.

```ts
  const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
    providers: [
      MyService,
      {
        provide: getLoggerToken(MyService.name),
        useValue: mockLogger,
      },
    ],
  }).compile();
```

## Logger/PinoLogger class extension

`Logger` and `PinoLogger` classes can be extended.

```ts
// logger.service.ts
import { Logger, PinoLogger, Params, PARAMS_PROVIDER_TOKEN } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Injectable()
class LoggerService extends Logger {
  constructor(
    logger: PinoLogger,
    @Inject(PARAMS_PROVIDER_TOKEN) params: Params
  ) {
    ...
  }
  // extended method
  myMethod(): any {}
}

import { PinoLogger, Params, PARAMS_PROVIDER_TOKEN } from 'nestjs-pino';

@Injectable()
class LoggerService extends PinoLogger {
  constructor(
    @Inject(PARAMS_PROVIDER_TOKEN) params: Params
  ) {
    // ...
  }
  // extended method
  myMethod(): any {}
}


// logger.module.ts
@Module({
  providers: [LoggerService],
  exports: [LoggerService],
  imports: [LoggerModule.forRoot()],
})
class LoggerModule {}
```

## Notes on `Logger` injection in constructor

Since logger substitution has appeared in NestJS@8 the main purpose of `Logger` class is to be registered via `app.useLogger(app.get(Logger))`. But that requires some internal breaking change, because with such usage NestJS pass logger's context as the last optional argument in logging function. So in current version `Logger`'s methods accept context as a last argument.

With such change it's not possible to detect if method was called by app internaly and the last argument is context or `Logger` was injected in some service via `constructor(private logger: Logger) {}` and the last argument is interpolation value for example.

## Assign extra fields for future calls

You can enrich logs before calling log methods. It's possible by using `assign` method of `PinoLogger` instance. As `Logger` class is used only for NestJS built-in `Logger` substitution via `app.useLogger(...)` this feature is only limited to `PinoLogger` class. Example:

```ts

@Controller('/')
class TestController {
  constructor(
    private readonly logger: PinoLogger,
    private readonly service: MyService,
  ) {}

  @Get()
  get() {
    // assign extra fields in one place...
    this.logger.assign({ userID: '42' });
    return this.service.test();
  }
}

@Injectable()
class MyService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(MyService.name);

  test() {
    // ...and it will be logged in another one
    this.logger.log('hello world');
  }
}
```

Due to the [limitation](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http/issues/30) of the underlying `pino-http` `PinoLogger.assign` cannot extend `Request completed` logs.

## Change pino params at runtime

Pino root instance with passed via module registration params creates a separate child logger for every request. This root logger params can be changed at runtime via `PinoLogger.root` property which is the pointer to logger instance. Example:

```ts
@Controller('/')
class TestController {
  @Post('/change-loggin-level')
  setLevel() {
    PinoLogger.root.level = 'info';
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Expose stack trace and error class in `err` property

By default, `pino-http` exposes `err` property with a stack trace and error details, however, this `err` property contains default error details, which do not tell anything about actual error. To expose actual error details you need you to use a NestJS interceptor which captures exceptions and assigns them to the response object `err` property which is later processed by pino-http:   

```typescript
import { LoggerErrorInterceptor } from 'nestjs-pino';

const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalInterceptors(new LoggerErrorInterceptor());
```

## Migration

### v1

- All parameters of v.0 are moved to `pinoHttp` property (except `useExisting`).
- `useExisting` now accept only `true` because you should already know if you want to use preconfigured fastify adapter's logger (and set `true`) or not (and just not define this field).

### v2

#### Logger substitution

A new more convenient way to inject a custom logger that implements `LoggerService` has appeared in recent versions of NestJS (mind the `bufferLogs` field, it will force NestJS to wait for logger to be ready instead of using built-in logger on start):

```ts
// main.ts
import { Logger } from 'nestjs-pino';
// ...
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, { bufferLogs: true });
  app.useLogger(app.get(Logger));
// ...
```

Note that for [standalone applications](https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications), buffering has to be [flushed using app.flushLogs()](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/24e6c821a0859448646fd88831f20e4c5ae50980/packages/core/nest-application-context.ts#L136) manually after custom logger is ready to be used by NestJS (refer to [this issue](https://github.com/iamolegga/nestjs-pino/issues/553) for more details):

```ts
// main.ts
import { Logger } from 'nestjs-pino';

// ... 
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule, { bufferLogs: true });
  app.useLogger(app.get(Logger));
  app.flushLogs();
// ...
```

In all the other places you can use built-in `Logger`:

```ts
// my-service.ts
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
class MyService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(MyService.name);
}
```

To quote the official docs:

> If we supply a custom logger via `app.useLogger()`, it will actually be used by Nest internally. That means that our code remains implementation agnostic, while we can easily substitute the default logger for our custom one by calling `app.useLogger()`.
>
> That way if we follow the steps from the previous section and call `app.useLogger(app.get(MyLogger))`, the following calls to `this.logger.log()` from `MyService` would result in calls to method `log` from `MyLogger` instance.

---

**This is recommended to update all your existing `Logger` injections from `nestjs-pino` to `@nestjs/common`. And inject it only in your `main.ts` file as shown above. Support of injection of `Logger` (don't confuse with `PinoLogger`) from `nestjs-pino` directly in class constructors is dropped.**

---

Since logger substitution has appeared the main purpose of `Logger` class is to be registered via `app.useLogger(app.get(Logger))`. But that requires some internal breaking change, because with such usage NestJS pass logger's context as the last optional argument in logging function. So in current version `Logger`'s methods accept context as the last argument.

With such change it's not possible to detect if method was called by app internaly and the last argument is context or `Logger` was injected in some service via `constructor(private logger: Logger) {}` and the last argument is interpolation value for example. That's why logging with such injected class still works, but only for 1 argument.

#### NestJS LoggerService interface breaking change

In NestJS@8 all logging methods of built-in `LoggerService` now accept the same arguments without second `context` argument (which is set via injection, see above), for example: `log(message: any, ...optionalParams: any[]): any;`. That makes usage of built-in logger more convenient and compatible with `pino`'s logging methods. So this is a breaking change in NestJS, and you should be aware of it.

In NestJS <= 7 and `nestjs-pino@1` when you call `this.logger.log('foo', 'bar');` there would be such log: `{..."context":"bar","msg":"foo"}` (second argument goes to `context` field by desing). In NestJS 8 and `nestjs-pino@2` (with proper injection that shown above) same call will result in `{..."context":"MyService","msg":"foo"}`, so `context` is passed via injection, but second argument disappear from log, because now it treats as interpolation value and there should be placeholder for it in `message` argument. So if you want to get both `foo` and `bar` in log the right way to do this is: `this.logger.log('foo %s', 'bar');`. More info can be found in [pino docs](https://getpino.io/#/docs/api?id=logging-method-parameters).

## FAQ

**Q**: _How to disable automatic request/response logs?_

**A**: check out [autoLogging field of pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http#pinohttpopts-stream) that are set in `pinoHttp` field of `Params`

---

**Q**: _How to pass `X-Request-ID` header or generate UUID for `req.id` field of log?_

**A**: check out [genReqId field of pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http#pinohttpopts-stream) that are set in `pinoHttp` field of `Params`

---

**Q**: _How does it work?_

**A**: It uses [pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http) under hood, so every request has it's own [child-logger](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/child-loggers.md), and with help of [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#async_context_class_asynclocalstorage) `Logger` and `PinoLogger` can get it while calling own methods. So your logs can be grouped by `req.id`.

---

**Q**: _Why use [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#async_context_class_asynclocalstorage) instead of [REQUEST scope](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes#per-request-injection)?_

**A**: [REQUEST scope](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes#per-request-injection) can have [perfomance issues](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes#performance). TL;DR: it will have to create an instance of the class (that injects `Logger`) on each request, and that will slow down your response times.

---

**Q**: _I'm using old nodejs version, will it work for me?_

**A**: Please check out [history of this feature](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#async_context_class_asynclocalstorage).

---

**Q**: _What about `pino` built-in methods/levels?_

**A**: Pino built-in methods names are not fully compatible with NestJS built-in `LoggerService` methods names, and there is an option which logger you use. Here is methods mapping:

| `pino` method | `PinoLogger` method | NestJS built-in `Logger` method |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| **trace**     | **trace**           | **verbose**     |
| debug         | debug               | debug           |
| **info**      | **info**            | **log**         |
| warn          | warn                | warn            |
| error         | error               | error           |
| **fatal**     | **fatal**           | -               |

---

**Q**: _Fastify already includes `pino`, and I want to configure it on `Adapter` level, and use this config for logger_

**A**: You can do it by providing `useExisting: true`. But there is one caveat:

Fastify creates logger with your config per every request. And this logger is used by `Logger`/`PinoLogger` services inside that context underhood.

But Nest Application has another contexts of execution, for example [lifecycle events](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/lifecycle-events), where you still may want to use logger. For that `Logger`/`PinoLogger` services use separate `pino` instance with config, that provided via `forRoot`/`forRootAsync` methods.

So, when you want to configure `pino` via `FastifyAdapter` there is no way to get back this config from fastify and pass it to that _out of context_ logger.

And if you will not pass config via `forRoot`/`forRootAsync` _out of context_ logger will be instantiated with default params. So if you want to configure it with the same options for consistency you have to provide the same config to `LoggerModule` configuration too. But if you already provide it to `LoggerModule` configuration you can drop `useExisting` field from config and drop logger configuration on `FastifyAdapter`, and it will work without code duplication.

So this property (`useExisting: true`) is not recommended, and can be useful only for cases when:

- this logger is not using for lifecycle events and application level logging in NestJS apps based on fastify
- `pino` is using with default params in NestJS apps based on fastify

All the other cases are lead to either code duplication or unexpected behavior.
